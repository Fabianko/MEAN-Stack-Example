# MEAN-Stack-Example
MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js) is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.  Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
